<p>The marsh harrier makes scoops of wings</p>
<p>Spilling just air enough to lollop over reeds</p>
<p>A quivering cloud of goldfinches lying low</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two outraged crows rush in behind this self-anointed queen</p>
<p></p>
<p>So effortless she turns </p>
<p>Talons rope and hooks outstretched </p>
<p>Back-flap crow with popping eyes</p>
<p>Hangs and gazes into hell</p>
<p></p>
<p>His friend remembers a prior engagement</p>
<p>"Do you feel lucky?"</p>
<p>She says carelessly</p>
<p>"Do you ...?"</p>
