<p>The marsh harrier made scoops of wings</p>
<p>Lazily spilling just enough air to lollop above the reeds</p>
<p>A nervous cloud of goldfinches lying low</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two outraged crows rushed in behind this self-anointed queen</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nonchalantly she turned </p>
<p>Talons outstretched </p>
<p>Nearest crow braked leaning back the other fled</p>
<p>"Do you feel lucky?"</p>
<p>She said slowly</p>
<p>"Do you ...?"</p>
