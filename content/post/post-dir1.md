##The Road to Brexit
###1. Fox Hunting

	What has fox hunting got to do with Brexit?  The abolition of hunting foxes for sport after a long and bitter popular and Parliamentary struggle provides a focal point for understanding who is behind Brexit and ultimately for understanding who owns the kingdom.
	
	We are supposed to believe that the UK is governed by a Parliamentary system that enacts the will of the people.  The institution is apparently the governing source of law and society and exists to organise and sustain the people of the land.
	
	Political Correctness is a term used to draw attention to the gap that exists between what people are allowed to say and what they actually believe or feel.  Parliament and democracy are the embodiment of what we are supposed to believe about the ownership of our society and fox hunting is a rare peek below the surface that covers what actually is.  What is said and what is true and what is believed can coexist while violent contradictions exist between them all.
	
	The legislation finally enacted by Parliament did not end fox hunting at all but it did symbolise a widespread distaste at the arrogance and display of the class of people involved in the hunting culture.  Nothing in the legislation provided for the eradication of that display.  It also did little to protect foxes.  The only police presence at contemporary fox hunts is there to block the continued interference of hunt saboteurs and to allow the ruling classes to pursue their sport untroubled.
	
	The law against hunting for foxes with packs of dogs did not end the priapic display but it did wound its dignity.  Its manhood was brought into question.
	
	Legislation was not needed to stop fox hunting.  People caught up in the sense of triumphalising the legislation seemed to be blind to the actuality.  A Secretary of State for the environment merely needed to add the fox to the list of protected species.  Powerful sanctions are attached to the legislation protecting wildlife unlike the milksop punishments for those hunting and killing foxes.
	
	The legislation would have had some teeth if it had made the creation of dog packs illegal.  A powerful symbol of the pomp and circumstance of the hunt.  More than a symbol perhaps, the soul of the event.
	
	Of course landowners who illegally allow the destruction of any wildlife on their land should have it taken away from them. They are not fit custodians.  Sadly we are a long way from this kind of a society.
	
	Fox hunting is important because it is a ritual that reenacts the rape and pillage of the land by the ancestors of the current aristocracy.  It is funny, or it would be if not that it is tragic, that the 'blood sport' is sometimes presented as some kind of over elabotrate pest control, as if we are stupid enough to believe that.  Those poor chickens I hear them cry.  We the KFC generation are unlikely to fall for that one.
	
	Just as relinquishing colonies such as Northern Ireland can not be tolerated as even a possibility so the outward public display of wealth and power won by butchery cannot become desanctified.  The blooding of the neophyte represents the abandonment of all ethics and morality that stand between power and its attainment.
	
	It might just have been the feeble poke at their tradition that has goaded that veiled class touched by a sense of their greater destiny to seize the initiative and turn all eyes back to them.
	
	Ordinary folk provided with shelter, food, entertainment and a sense of security for their children do not much care who is in charge or what they get up to but the whole edifice of power is rooted in their daily labour, their fear of the law and to some extent co-operation.  Goaded they can be a powerful tool.  Get the goading wrong and they become dangerous.  
	
	The understanding and beliefs of working people have to be carefully managed.  This has been understood by the rulers since the dawn of human civilisation.   Thus the Classics remain important in the education of the aspiring.  There is some expertise after all this time.
	
###2. Some Reflections on UKIP

	Deflecting the dissatisfaction of the masses away from a system of power when it is failing to deliver satisfaction is an ancient art form.
	
	In the build up to the vote on Brexit there was a television news piece on the anger of a woman living in the North East - Sunderland or thereabouts - who complained that most of the children in her daughter's class at school did not have English as their primary language.  They spoke a variety of European languages, mostly Polish.  She complained that this would ruin her daughter's chances to succeed and get on in the world.  European migrants were ruining her daughter's life chances.
	
	Now it is a shame that groups of newcomers are not seen as more than a resource that should know its place.  The people of this Island need to adopt as much as possible from the wider world including its languages.  People need to be part of a planetary community.  Our species is on the brink in so many ways.  But the power of nation state rulers thrives on cultural uniformity, monoglotism, and a sense of vulnerability to anything from outside.  Do we need to be reminded that the wealthy own property in many lands, are well connected internationally, learn other languages?  Do we not wonder how the wealth we create can be invested anywhere on the planet where the pickings are richest and the labour most oppressed?  Do we not wonder why our taxes are used to uphold and support regimes of great brutality?
	
	Yes, there was a problem in Sunderland but not one caused by the humans delighted to make a new home there.  It was a failure of the authorities to make proper provision for either the English speaking community or that of the newcomers.  
	
	The problem with popular media is that it creates the world as a perfect place whose equilibrium becomes disturbed by the apparent random news items of the day.  It floats outside of context or evidence or scrutiny.  It never demands that its audience dedicate itself to years of study and thought before reacting emotionally to its content.  I put aside the issues of ownership and state controls and interference in the media. 
	
	A thought on dissatisfaction:  at its height the British Empire chanelled two thirds of the wealth of the planet to this island.  What then was the condition of the working population?  As the working class stumbled towards political self-awareness a better deal for the working life was grudgingly ceded.  Along with a message that to be English was to be privileged beyond measure in a world full of savages.  No matter your humiliating poverty you were still better than nearly everyone else.
	
	In 1914 it was considered reasonable to tell the british working classes that German soldiers feasted on Belgian babies.  Oh yes, not so long ago we were told that Iraqi soldiers stormed an infancy unit in Kuwait and killed all the babies.
	
	What UKIP brought to modern Britain was the ability to construct a racist (resentalist) discourse around people with light skins.  The clever ones understood the code and the rules of this game, buoyed on by the success of this injection of thinly veiled racism into national public debate the idiotic ones segued into full public expression of hatred of all 'immigrants' and that clearly meant the ones they could 'see' and didn't like.  The covert racism of so many conservative voters was being made to look insipid in the face of this boisterous jingoism from the right.
	
	Hence the often pained expression on the face of Nigel Farage.  He was working with some very unpolished political material.  His, the face of the average bloke down the boozer, belying his education, his class affiliation and his backers, and his insidious disdain for the people he sought to manipulate.  UKIP strove to deliver a voice of inclusion for all who could be persuaded their way of life was under threat from these grasping outsiders;  it presented European migrants and the concomitant route for others to Britain through Europe as a source of impending doom.
	
	Despite the apparent embarassment of the UKIP leadership there would have been glee at the endless faux pas.  No publicity is bad publicity.  Even through their scandals they gained because they were being made to look important.  Serious contenders.
	
	How then did Nigel Farage obtain access to a prime-time live TV debate with the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg?
	
	The live TV debate is a problem for politicians.  If you are in power you have a great deal to lose in this kind of event and little to gain.  To refuse to engage in a public debate can be seen as a sign of weakness yet participating runs the risk of having your weaknesses exposed.  The political underdog truly has far less to lose.  I cannot imagine what the official Labout Party opposition would have given to go one-on-one prime time with Nick Clegg.  Like throwing a goldfish to a shark.
	
	All Nick Clegg could bring to the debate was ultimately more of the same old same old.  Nobody expected Farage to bring reason and evidence based sanity to this debate.  His role was to unnerve and sideline the Government.  He was there as a rhetorician and a demagogue.  Nick Clegg, a non-member of the ruling party was there as a sacrifial lamb.  If Farage behaved irreverently, sneering and chuckling he would carry his supporters and appeal to many more who want to see their smug and ineffectual leaders discomfited.  The risk to the Tories was always going to be a loss of face to their racist leaning supporters.  Sadly this applies equally to Labour's racist leaning supporters.
	
	I can only conclude that this was all known and scripted.   Somebody was telling the executive what to do.
	
	Why should a load of uninformed and inaccurate jingoistic rhetoric hyped up in the press lead to a referendum?  A referendum based on a simple majority.  A referendum on a simple question about two completely unrelated ideas.
	
###3. In or Out - Choice or Illusion?
	
	I want to expand this idea of being in or out of the EU as two unrelated ideas.  Being in the EU is being part of a process that has global reach.  The EU as an economic entity has manipulated and controlled a substantial part of the world economy for decades.  This power has created great leverage in world strategic matters.  It has conspired to make one hour of an EU member's labour able to purchase, shall we say 20 hours of labour from SE Asia.
	
	This had been achieved through great skullduggery and the ability to continue to capitalise on the colonial legacy.  To integrate into this and to win benefits from it has involved billions of hours of involvement by politicians, lawyers, civil servants, business people, workers' organisations, military personnel, state security personnel, police forces, customs and excise officials, health and safety inspectorates and perhaps less consciously all of us.  And that is just skimming.
	
	The UK has worked hard to gain benefits at minimum costs to itself and has worked tirelessly to keep the emphasis on the expansion of economic development without conceding too much in terms of political integration.  As I have said elsewhere the unprovoked destruction of Iraq under Saddam Hussein is an eloquent example of how little political influence could be exerted on the UK by the EU.  Being in the EU brought advantages of military security and more importantly food security.  The UK could attract massive inward investment because its products made here could be exported under EU terms of trade.  So not only could tariffs be avoided for exports inside the EU but also but world exports could be made under favourable EU negotiated tariff regimes.
	
	It all amounted to member states people being able to consume at a far higher level than they produce.
	
	The other side of the vote - leaving?  Well it does not have billions of hours of work and decades of living practice behind it.  There was a time before the UK was in the EEC (at that time).  The UK was begging to join for a much reduced deal and influence than it has now.   The UK was pretty grim by contemporary standards.  But of course the world has changed massively in the meantime.  So is it easier to 'go it alone' now that it was then?
	
	Back then the UK was producing a lot of coal and steel and cars.  Energy was cheap with North Sea oil and gas still on the way.  There was a large workforce with a great diversity of skills but we were already being told we were going to have to compete with overseas workers in a world economy.  The political elite both Labour and Tory set about rooting the 'left' out of workplaces, political parties, and the Trade Union movement.  It was a bloody time. 
	
	What does leaving the EU mean now, what does going it alone mean?  For a start UK workers will be told they have to compete with workers of the world.  To win contracts over the EU the UK will have to undercut it and try and outmanoevre it.  One hour of a British worker's labour will need to equate to one hour of an Indian worker's labour in purchasing power instead of one hour of a French worker's.  If not people will always choose the Indian product and so on.  I can perceive lots of new jobs appearing but at what rates of pay?  What standard of living?
	
	Do not misunderstand my statements as enthusiasm for the EU.  I am simply trying to communicate what I can see.  Have you spent time at a food bank?  Surely you have seen the people living and begging in our streets.  Employment figures are a confection.  Masses of people not hidden from the figures are under-employed, working part-time, or working far below their capabilities and expectations.  Modern Britain is no Nirvana.
	
	In or out?  Well being out is not like a football transfer.  Say instead, it is like Ronaldo choosing between Real Madrid and a job with the corporation waste collection service.
	
	UKIP's agenda was only of consequence because the Tory party and the right-wing press made it so.  There was virtually no coverage or comment linked to the Labour Party during this period.  Except of course related to internal Labout Party affairs.  I do not know if that party was just too inward looking to contribute to the debate or, more likely, afraid of it.  I suspect all participants wanted the Labour Party out of the debate and the Labour Party was happy to comply.
	
	The vote was rigged.  Clearly.  It was not even sane.  It was a powerful group determined on restoring its absolute autonomy in this land that have brought this about. People who will continue to enjoy an international lifestyle and speak foreign languages. The people who want this will feel no pain because they own this land and believe in their right to do so.  No one can act above or outside of their interests.
	
	Was the ban on fox hunting the last straw?  I cannot think of any other indignity they have suffered.
	
	There is more.  Nothing can be understood in international relations and political economy without understanding the shift from US to Chinese world economic hegemony.  The US is working hard to resist this and the UK is a dispensable attack dog on a leash.  It will now have to figure out which bully to serve.  Winning arguments and shaping policy in Europe might have made some here feel important but outside of the kennel it is a wild and frightening world.
