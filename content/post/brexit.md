Mass votes indeed any voting at all should be the last resort for anything.  Put it to the vote if you dare when the data and analysis leaves a decision so finely balanced that the best course cannot be followed on the basis of the evidence.  But perhaps some decisions are so finely balanced or have such wildly unpredictable outcomes that they should not be made at all.  Back to the drawing board as it were.

When things are unclear it is mostly better to postpone a commitment to a particular course of action.  You know that thing where you lose something and reach a point where you stop looking for it and decide to let it come looking for you.

The first thing that screamed out at me about the Brexit vote was: however can such a significant unbalanced choice be subjected to a simple either/or majority vote?  Even a stamp club would demand a three-quarters or two-thirds majority on a constitutional change.   Shall we focus exclusively on stamps pre-dating World War II?  The constitution of this club explicitly lays down that it is open to all collectors of all stamps of any origin!  The constitution also says that this can only be changed by a secret ballot of the entire membership and requires a 75% majority to be carried.

Why unbalanced?  Because being in or out of the EU is like comparing chewing gum with banisters.  It is not a balanced equivalence even if it sounds like one in simple language.

I should mention that I did not vote in this debacle.  It was clearly an outrageous fix.  The day voting took place England was playing France in the European football championship.  Of all the possible dates to pick the Tory government chose a day of maximum jingoism.   They could not have known that England would be playing France that day, that was simply the icing on the cake, but they knew that England would be horribly winning or more likely horribly losing in Europe.  Either way it would help the cause of the leave campaign.  Or rather it could be seen as yet another element contributing legitimacy to a predetermined outcome.

The campaign leading up to the vote was beyond facile.  I include both sides.  I spent seven years as an academic studying and teaching the context, history, economics and politics of the creation and development of the EU.  After seven years I had barely scratched the surface.

I did not notice that any academics were allowed near the media debate.  The people who voted for and against the proposal were all equally unable to make a choice based on anything other than rhetoric and demagoguery.

If I had voted it would have been to remain.  This would have been based on pure greedy self-interest.  Working class people can only lose out in a terrible fashion from the vote to leave.  Our local ruling elite is one of the craftiest and most vindictive in history.  Our parliamentary system provides the most cunning disguises of elite power ever conceived.  What little protection of human dignity that could be provided inside the Union is gone forever.  I wonder if we shall remain to be called citizens or once again named subjects?

In the greater scheme of things it really does not matter.  The European project presides over massive inequalities in wealth, homelessness, social deprivation, racism, barely disguised nationalism, youth unemployment enough to deeply shame these so called enlightened states in the 21st Century.  For years now we have had 'food banks' in the UK.  People turn up at these in an awful state with vouchers begging and crying to be given food.

The EU is a massive trading cartel.  Ironically an anathaema to Capitalism.  It is designed to wreak havoc on world markets, to inflict poverty and suffering on those less able to protect themselves.  While European politicians bleat on about free and open markets they use the Union for the self-enrichment of the local elites at the expense of emerging economies.

The EU is not a nice organisation.   But neither is the UK.

As a digression I remember studying and discussing the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  We were looking at nationalism and at the fact that opportunistic nationalists, the nascent ruling elite, love to bang on about the horror of being ruled by a foreign ruling class.   They forget to mention that all ruling classes are a source of horror irrespective of their land of birth.

Which neatly brings me to the issue of Sovereignty.

Now I would say that the UK was hardly in the EU in the first place.  The UK declined the Schengen agreement allowing free movement of people between signatory states.  Despite being the only member surrounded by a bloody great moat.  

The UK had systematically and successfully pushed for a broad and shallow union.  In other words, bringing in so many new members that any profound melding of Western Europe into a single legal and political entity could never happen.

Very importantly the UK stayed out of the Euro zone.  How the EU failed to make that a compulsory element of membership I can only guess.  But certainly the UK would have fought and vetoed any such idea into the ground.

The UK received maximum benefit with minimum jeopardy.

Sovereignty.  Since WWII the UK has been subservient to the USA in political, military and economic matters.  Suez in 1956 was the last pitiful attempt by the ruling elite here to lay a marker proving that the brits were still a global force in their own right.  It was a deeply shameful and humiliating affair.  The USA used it to ram home the point - you jump when we say so and only when we say so.

To reinforce the point you only have to look at the war of unprovoked aggression against Iraq.  Clearly this was one part of an overall strategy to gain military control over the whole region in the face of China preparing to buy oil in non-dollar currencies and to infiltrate the area economically.  The Western powers are determined to establish a military presence right up to the borders of China, and Russia (largely accomplished) for that matter.  There can be no autonomous powers in the Middle east.  No dispersal of loyalties.

The other European states in the EU were opposed to this course of action.  They had no influence over UK decision makers at all.  Indeed the whole of the UN could exert no influence over the UK in this matter.  So yes, there is a problem about sovereignty.  Despite unprecedented opposition from the people of the UK and the world the political leadership of the UK was more fearful of the trans-Atlantic master.  Being branded a war criminal by your own people bears no threat compared to the wrath of Washington DC.

That Brexit vote.  It could have been about committing an army of academics, civil servants, human rights authorities, representatives of business and labour to spend 5 years investigating the implications of leaving the EU.  There could have been 5 years of discussion and informed documentaries about the idea.  A big budget could have been allocated to this.

Everything could have been in place to deliver a sane exit if that is what was chosen - on a two-thirds majority.

People who consider themselves to be various kind of socialists are looking forward to a new and clear polarisation between the UK labour force and the local and now clearly identifiable bosses.  Perhaps theyhave forgotten that the glory days of post-war trade unionism were fueled by a labour shortage when surplus capital could not be exported and not by an innate grasp of class war by the working class.  The EU was too big and too integrated to challenge.  They have of course underestimated the surge in right-wing demagoguery that will hold sway in the media here as things begin to deteriorate in the lives of ordinary people.  Many here who lable themselves socialists are deeply parochial, nationalistic, and ingrained with that sense of innate british superiority to all foreigners.

We will have endless foreign threats paraded before us, endless false flag actions, we will be told that to strike or to complain is unpatriotic, treasonous even.  We will be told that in a world market we have to compete on a level playing field with oppressed workers in countries whose fascistic systems we encourage and support.

In the 1970s Denis Healey appeared on tv with his belly bursting out of his trousers and told us that we were paying ourselves more than we earn.  He failed to mention the collapse of the post war world economic system known as Bretton-Woods.  He told us that we should 'tighten our belts'.  I was an undernourished child willing him to tighten his own belt and suffer the inevitable ensuing cranial aneurism.

I have to mention immigration.  In the build up to the Brexit vote we were assailed for months with endless stories of human wreckage moving in waves toward our shores.  Some stories were frightening in tone, some were tragic.  They were all unsettling, disingenuous, and designed to create unease and for many fear.

The media muddled up stories of peoples on the move from the middle east  - a situation largely brought about by the UK and the USA - people fleeing deprivation and persecution from various African states and former colonies, and EU citizens exercising their rights to reside in the UK.  Any one story might have been nuanced and balanced if you paid attention but as a whole the UK media hammered us with this material.  A lot of visual material but no attempt at a context or differentiation. 

It all stopped the day after the vote for Brexit.  Brexit makes all the bad people go away in a puff of smoke.

What an irony.  Millions of lives ruined as a direct consequence of recent and historic UK activity in the world.   Yet these fellow humans were being presented to us as an army of lazy yet dangerous graspers being delivered on our doorstep by the infernally weak European Union with its pesky residency arrangements and leaky borders.

Not many people noticed that the week before the vote Médecins Sans Frontières announced that in the face of the inhumanity of the EU and of individual EU member states in dealing with refugees it would no longer accept donations from the EU or its member states.  It was washing its hands of this dirty money.  In the late '80s EEC experts were already writing papers on the theme of 'Fortress Europe'.   A walled enclave for privilege and mutual protection.  A wall against outsiders.

A charity refusing money?  MSF was refusing to be exploited as the conscience of the unconscionable behaviour of some of the richest and supposedly most humanitarian states in the history of our planet.  It needs to be uninfluenced by the EU to unequivocally expose the horror of being a person washed up on its shores.

Ironically the wealthy denisons of our Island have homes in many countries, speak more than one language and operate in a global space.  Money has no passports to worry about.  It is deployed where labour is cheapest and most exploitable.  When people try to flow like the wealthy or the money of the wealthy they are punished and vilified.

And people only try to flow when they are desperate because it is made so bloody difficult for them the rest of the time.  To add insult to injury large masses of people are either forcibly uprooted or given incentives to move when labour markets are undersubscribed.  Hence the role of the Tories, ironically, in drawing in people from the Caribbean to the UK when labour became more of a 'seller's market' in the immediate post-war period.  Flood the labour market, break the unions.

When I voted for the Common Market as an eighteen year old I had starry eyed ideas about traveling and working and living in a large and engrossing space.  Meeting lots of people from other lands and learning and changing and growing because of it.

In actual fact it was never that easy to live as a European for people from working class backgrounds.  Not only is it difficult to become distant from the familiar, the family ties, the native tongue, the diet and mores of one's own childhood experience but there is a mountain of red tape to be understood and dealt with.  The easy passing across borders and the simple expectation of being at least bilingual were never the norm in the UK.  

As a student in Germany I had to register with the local authority to reside there for a year, obtain a card allowing me temporary rights to seek employment, set up a bank account and a bunch of other things.  It was not too hard for me but I was studying and becoming fluent in German.  I could not imagine how a regular working family could even contemplate moving there to live.  

The EU has not significantly impacted on the behaviour and expectations of the UK working population.  It has remained insular not least because of the importance of the English language - so important because of the global reach of the USA.

The EU has delivered a powerful economic and military bloc to protect the interests of the local ruling groups.  As part of a larger Western Alliance it has been able to look after its interests and continue to exploit those former colonies that so enriched our region in the past.  

How to conclude this polemical exposition.  Our world is teetering on the edge of colossal change.  There are several areas of great threat to our civilisations and to our biological viability.  The dinosaurs thrived for millions of years, the Roman Empire for 400 years, the economic hegemony of the USA for perhaps one hundred years, debatable of course, and China is waiting in the wings.  Brexit is really a historical footnote in the unfolding situation.

Our systems do not work.  Families fail, friendships can turn into hatred, communities quickly become a hotbed of mistrust and manipulation.  Our world systems preside over biting injustice and inhumanity and terror.  Middle class angst about damage to personal wellbeing amongst the most privileged humans who have ever lived seems ridiculous.  People are concerned about their own pensions while they consume cheap goods produced by workers living in deep poverty and under oppressive rulership.   

Wealthy people are building bunkers. Brexit is a historical irrelevance.
