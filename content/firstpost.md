<h2>Our Journey to the Stars or Should We Stay at Home?</h2>

Questions of ethics:

Who says we can go stomping around on other planets?

Have we shown that we are capable and responsible denizens of a planet? 

Should we not become respectful custodians of our own world before we even consider messing about with other worlds?

We have already created pollution beyond the boundaries of our world, we are considering terminating the natural development of other worlds.  This will happen by definition when we visit other planets.  How do we assume this right?

Questions of self preservation:

If we piss someone off out there who will they come looking for?  NASA?

If microbes can exist in harsh conditions is there not a great possibility that they could be dangerously invasive on earth.

These sorts of questions need to be addressed not merely by corporations or politicians or panels of experts with their short-term vested interests, these sort of questions need to be addressed by us all.  What is done off our world is done in the name of our species.

We need to be screaming at the top of our lungs, "Stop and explain what it is we understand about our own world so well that we dare go anywhere else!" 


Space is not an adventure or an untapped resource.  Space is an ecosystem.
