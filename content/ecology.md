**Ecology**

This electronic artifice is here as part of a remarkable interconnected web of minds, technologies, and possibly universes, that reach and touch all things from all times.

A crude summary of the ecology of this page:

1. GNU Linux
2. Go language
3. Hugo - static web site bilder
4. Python
5. Ruby
6. AWS S3 - cloud storage - bucket
7. AWS Cloudfront - site distribution service
8. Git - code repository and all purpose projectversion control and distribution.
9. Giraffe Academy - tutorials
10. Remarkable - Markdown editor
11. GPL and similar or associated licenses that have provided a structure to make these technologies readily available to any human who haas access to the infrastructure
12. FOSS advocates and workers all over the world


This page is made from a mixture of open and closed technologies and this includes the hardware as well as the software.

We dream of a day when all technology admits its debt to all life on this planet and becomes fully accessible in its totality to all sentient beings here.

So a crude list of bits and a big thank you to the primaeval source.
