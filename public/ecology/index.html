  <p><strong>Ecology</strong></p>

<p>This electronic artifice is here as part of a remarkable interconnected web of minds, technologies, and possibly universes, that reach and touch all things from all times.</p>

<p>A crude summary of the ecology of this page:</p>

<ol>
<li>GNU Linux</li>
<li>Go language</li>
<li>Hugo - static web site bilder</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>AWS S3 - cloud storage - bucket</li>
<li>AWS Cloudfront - site distribution service</li>
<li>Git - code repository and all purpose projectversion control and distribution.</li>
<li>Giraffe Academy - tutorials</li>
<li>Remarkable - Markdown editor</li>
<li>GPL and similar or associated licenses that have provided a structure to make these technologies readily available to any human who haas access to the infrastructure</li>
<li>FOSS advocates and workers all over the world</li>
</ol>

<p>This page is made from a mixture of open and closed technologies and this includes the hardware as well as the software.</p>

<p>We dream of a day when all technology admits its debt to all life on this planet and becomes fully accessible in its totality to all sentient beings here.</p>

<p>So a crude list of bits and a big thank you to the primaeval source.</p>
